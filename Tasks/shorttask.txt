# Quick Project Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up and run the project from scratch.

## Prerequisites

- React + Vite
- Node.js & npm
- MongoDB (a local instance or a cloud-based one like MongoDB Atlas)

---

## 1. Backend Setup (Node.js + Express)

1.  Navigate to the `backend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  Install all required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

---

## 2. Frontend Setup (React + Vite)

This section assumes you are in the project's root directory (the one containing the `backend` folder).

1.  Create a new React + Vite project named `frontend`:
    ```bash
    npm create vite@latest frontend -- --template react
    ```
2.  Navigate into the new `frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
3.  Install all required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.
    npm install react-router-dom

## 3. Running the Application

**Important:** Both the backend and frontend servers must be running at the same time for the application to work correctly.

1.  **Terminal 1 (Backend):**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm run dev
    ```
2.  **Terminal 2 (Frontend):**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run dev
    ```
    npm install jwt-decode
